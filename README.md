# GitExercise

1. Create a folder called “GitExercise” inside of the “Git” folder

2. Inside that folder create a file called “name.txt”

3. Open the file and write your name in it

4. Initialize/Create a git repository in the GitExercise folder

5. ADD and COMMIT the name.txt file (Remember to include a commit message)

6. Create a folder inside the GitExercise folder called “Favorites. ”Inside the Favorites folder create two files with the following titles: 
    season.txt (Open file and type out your favorite season of the year)
    holiday.txt (Open file and type out your favorite holiday of the year)

Go back into the GitExercise folder

ADD and COMMIT everything inside the Favorites folder (Remember to include a commit message)

Create a new repository on GitHub.com called “GitExercise” (No description needed. Leave on Public.)

Push your folder/files up to GitHub by pasting the commands from GitHub into your terminal (Remember you can just click the clipboard to copy the commands)

Refresh your GitHub page after you complete this step to confirm it was done correctly

BONUS: Create two more files in your GitExercise folder…

confidential.txt (Open file and type out what you really think about us)

notConfidential.txt (Open file and type out a message about how awesome we are)
Create a gitignore file
Use the gitignore file so that ONLY the “notConfidential.txt” will be added to the staging area when using the “git add .” command
Commit the notConfidential.txt file
Run the “git push” command so the notConfidential.txt will show up on your GitHub page
